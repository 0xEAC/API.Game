# API Game Description

>## **Welcome** to my API Backend Game!

In this game you can create, feed, breed, pet and release animals!

Each animal has a state, hunger level, age and health level.

Every few seconds the hunger level decreases, you have to keep your animals fed or they might end up dying from starvation!  
But keep in mind, if a animal reaches a certain age it will also die.  
Feel free to try it out!
